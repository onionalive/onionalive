# 'starwars' incremental-game
A small incremental game I am making; based loosely off of kittens game and a dark room. 

Planned trajectory -

<ul>
  <li>1) Mine asteroids for minerals (eventually able to get more [gold, spice, etc.])</li>
  <li>2) Build science advances, eventually grow large enough to enter production phase (weapons, space ships, etc.)</li>
  <li>3) SMUGGLE GOODS!</li>
  <li>4) settle already excisting planets with your buildings</li>
  <li>5) side with republic or empire (working on what sides ill work with; those are place holders)</li>
  <li>6) build jedi/sith academys</li>
  <li>7) Take over / save planets based on side you chose</li>
</ul>

and MORE!
This is a fun side project im doing to finally delve into javascript and all its libraries
If anyone wants to help or give me tips; it would be greatly appreciated
