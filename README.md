# 'starwars' incremental-game
A small incremental game I am making; based loosely off of kittens game and a dark room. 

Planned trajectory -

1) Mine asteroids for minerals (eventually able to get more [gold, spice, etc.])
2) Build science advances, eventually grow large enough to enter production phase (weapons, space ships, etc.)
3) SMUGGLE GOODS!
4) settle already excisting planets with your buildings
5) side with republic or empire (working on what sides ill work with; those are place holders)
6) build jedi/sith academys
7) Take over / save planets based on side you chose

and MORE!
This is a fun side project im doing to finally delve into javascript and all its libraries
If anyone wants to help or give me tips; it would be greatly appreciated
